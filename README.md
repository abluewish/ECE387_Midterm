# ECE387_Midterm
This project contains a library that can do with an ENG sensor.
The library consists of Convert.h and Convert.cpp. To use this library, you need to download .h and .cpp file and put them into Arduino's library path. 

To call methods in the library, we can run test examples ended with .ino in Arduino IDE.

Some changes still need to be made.

The demo1 is presented on Youtube(URL: https://youtu.be/ZSIWmz92eBg).
